Hi,

We have the following piece of code in fs/cifs/connect.c (linux):

	struct smb_vol fake_vol = {0};

Where smb_vol is a struct containing pointers. AFAIK this construct is
valid so I think it's a bug. Sorry for the noise if this has already
been reported.

Cheers,

I was just about to reply with similar comments (along with some
commentary on explicit/implicit initialization and designated
initializers, etc). However, I was going to say that it is a
shame that the C language does not allow an empty initializer
list (ie {}) as that would be my preferred solution! ;-)

Ahem, so yes, both gcc and clang allow this (I just tested it), but
my reading of the C99 standard lead me to believe that this is not
valid C. (Not that it really matters).

I didn't know that gcc supported the empty form as an extension.

http://c0x.coding-guidelines.com/6.7.8.html
It's in section 6.7.9 of the C11 edition of the Standard.

Hi,

Yes, this is valid/legal C, no discussion about it.
But I think that a lot, if not most, GCC's (and other compiler's)
*warnings* are about valid constructions which are considered as
dangerous, obsolete, possibly buggy, ...
For the present case, sparse gives a warnings because the goal is
to prevent a possible type error by using an integer as a pointer.
Stricter type checking is, essentially, sparse's "raison d'être".

The best should be to be able to use { } since it would do the
default-initialize for all members without having to know their
type and their order but as others have already noticed this is
not valid C. This is an error in the standard, IMO.
So if you want to use strictly standard C and avoid the warning
you have to use '{ NULL }'.

Best regards,

Using of 0 in this context does not make the source non-strictly
conforming.

"An integer constant expression with the value 0, or such an expression 
cast to type void *, is called a null pointer constant."

Yes, sure, using 0 here is perfectly legal but sparse being what it is
(a C checker having stricter type checking than GCC and/or standard C)
it gives a an explicit warning when 0 is used to initialize (or compare
to) a pointer and the warning is enabled by default. This is quite
similar to GCC's -Wzero-as-null-pointer-constant but this last warning
is only valid for C++, not C.

Like, I'm asking on the other sub-thread, maybe this warning should be
relaxed. I don't know and don't have a strong opinion about it.

OK, so I spent some time reading the C99 and C11 standards and
I _still_ can't see how this could be valid C!

So, I beat on gcc some more:

$ cat -n junk.c
     1	#include <stdio.h>
     2	
     3	int main (int argc, char *argv[])
     4	{
     5		struct { char *f; int i; } fred = {};
     6		printf("fred.f %p (%s), fred.i %d\n", fred.f, fred.f, fred.i);
     7		return 0;	
     8	}
$ gcc -std=c99 -pedantic -Wall -Wextra -o junk junk.cjunk.c: In function âmainâ:
junk.c:5:36: warning: ISO C forbids empty initializer braces [-Wpedantic]
  struct { char *f; int i; } fred = {};
                                    ^
junk.c:3:15: warning: unused parameter âargcâ [-Wunused-parameter]

               ^~~~
junk.c:3:27: warning: unused parameter âargvâ [-Wunused-parameter]
 int main (int argc, char *argv[])
                           ^~~~
$ ./junk
fred.f (nil) ((null)), fred.i 0
$ 

... and finally got it to admit that {} is not ISO C (with -pedantic).

[I was starting to doubt myself! ;-) ]

No.

The fact is, anybody who thinks that "0" is a good value for NULL is
not somebody I want to have anything to do with.

It's a *horrible* value for NULL, and it's completely unacceptable.

Yes, yes, I realize that it's the canonical value in K&R C. But that
was then, and K&R C doesn't really have much of a type system anyway -
just look at function declarations. K&R C is simply not worth worrying
about, it's legacy.

Any language which allows you to write

    strnlen(0, NULL);

without screaming about getting the types entirely wrong for both
arguments is simply not worth using. We got over the old K&R C
braindamage long ago.

So sparse does the right thing. 0 is not NULL. It's not acceptable.
And NULL cannot ever be used in an integer context as the number '0'.
That's simply not acceptable.

This is such a fundamental type safety issue that I don't understand
how anybody can ever be confused about it.

So no, sparse warning about completely invalid use of the integer 0
for NULL is not a bad warning. It's fundamental.

And yes, I realize that the C++ people completely screwed up, and
originally doubled down on the old K&R C model of "NULL must be 0". It
took them a decade or more to understand just how wrong they were, but
they finally got over it. It's C++, what can I say?

The fact that the C++ people had no taste, and the fact that a lot of
C compilers have to dead with old per-K&R C and deal with header files
and legacy programs that still assume "0 is a valid NULL pointer" is
entirely immaterial.

The whole and *ONLY* point of sparse was to be better at typechecking
than C is. And the 0-vs-NULL confusion is just the most fundamental
and part of that.

They finally fixed it with the "nullptr" symbol (and "nullptr_t" type of
it - which makes no sense in a pure C world).

#define nullptr (void*)0

in C, use it instead of "NULL" and that's it totally pure clean C since
K&R;-)
Something like that should actually have gone in some C standard ages
ago ....

There are situations (e.g. like execv() and friends) where it *is*
(always) a (with execv() a "char*") pointer context but the C-compiler
has no chance to know it because it's a variable argument list (except
with special handling on the name of the sys-call/funtion within the
compiler).

No they really wouldn't.

That was always a completely bogus argument.

It's noit "0" that is NULL, it's "((void *)0)".

If C++ had gotten that _simple_ thing right, they'd not have had the
problems that they did.

There were a lot of C++ people who argued like you did, from ignorance
and stuipidity.

Then, decades later, when they finally realized they were wrong, they
had spent so much time arguing that "((void *)0)" couldn't just be
NULL, that they clearly were too embarrassed to admit that they had
been wrong all this time, so they made up a new "better" model:

> They finally fixed it with the "nullptr" symbol (and "nullptr_t" type of

Absolutely. There were a _lot_ of C++ people who couldn't just admit
that "((void *)0)" would have been a perfectly valid way to spell
"nullptr", so they made a whole new keyword instead.

No, K&R C didn't have "void" or "void *".

But

   #define NULL ((void *)0)

has been valid C since ANSI C, and the C++ people should just have
accepted that as the spelling for "nullptr" too.

Note that it's the whole *cast* that is the NULL pointer. The above is
not "integer cast to 'void *'". No, it _is_ NULL inside the compiler
(because NULL literally has special meaning even in C, even if the
special meaning is less than the special meaning in C++).

So my point is that it's "nullptr" that is made up silliness. But it's
made up silliness because of politics, and because a lot of C++ people
had trouble admitting that the ANSI C "let's just accept a cast to
'void *'" was perfectly fine.

Some people got hung up about the "cast to 'void *'". That's not what
makes it a NULL pointer, and in C++ that special construct of "cast 0
to void *" could easily just had the type 'nullptr_t'.

Really. Exactly the same way that K&R C (and then C++) gave special
semantics to the (inferior) "#define NULL 0", and magically turned
that *inferior* model for NULL into nullptr.

But I also believe that a lof of C++ people had argued themselves into
a corner where admitting that simply wasn't possible - because it
would have involved admitting that they did some really stupid things
for decades.

Thus the syntactic sugar of calling it "nullptr", allowing some people
to claim they were right all along, when they were just being
incredibly stupid.

Just to clarify: a lot of people seem to think that

    #define NULL ((void *)0)

means that NULL just behaves as a "void *" and is thus compatible with
all other pointers, and that's it.

Nope. Even in C, NULL is actually special in ways that have nothing to
do with "void *" part. You should think of the "(void *)" part as just
syntactic sugar, that makes sure it cannot be mistaken for a regular
integer, and helps turn it into the special thing that NULL is.

It's just way less _noticeably_ special than it is in C++.

In particular, it's special wrt the ternary operator.

If you have

    void *a;
    int *b;

then the expression

    cond ? a : b;

has type 'void *'.

But

    cond ? NULL : b;

has type "int *".

Notice how NULL - even in C - doesn't act as "just another void
pointer". It really is its own special value, and has its own rules
for typing, _outside_ of the rules of "void *" pointers.

This was always true, btw. The C++ people who told you that you couldn't do

    #define NULL ((void *)0)

in C++, because NULL is not just another void pointer were full of
shit.  ANSI C did it, and did it right. Long long long before the C++
people invented a completely pointless new syntax for the same thing.

It's sad that this has to be stated even in the year 2018.

C++ used to have the same behavior as C.  During the early days of work
on the first C++ standard it was decided to change the behavior (various
arguments about it making overload resolution less confusing; obviously
so they could add the confusion in other places ;-).

From:Miss: Fatima Yusuf.

For sure this mail would definitely come to you as a surprise, but do take your good time to go through it, My name is Ms. Fatima Yusuf,i am from Ivory Coast.

I lost my parents a year and couple of months ago. My father was a serving director of the Agro-exporting board until his death. He was assassinated by his business partners.Before his death, he made a deposit of US$9.7 Million Dollars here in Cote d'ivoire which was for the purchase of cocoa processing machine and development of another factory before his untimely death.

Being that this part of the world experiences political and crises time without number, there is no guarantee of lives and properties. I cannot invest this money here any long, despite the fact it had been my late father's industrial plans.

I want you to do me a favor to receive this funds into your country or any safer place as the beneficiary, I have plans to invest this money in continuation with the investment vision of my late father, but not in this place again rather in your country. I have the vision of going into real estate and industrial production or any profitable business venture.

I will be ready to compensate you with 20% of the total Amount, now all my hope is banked on you and i really wants to invest this money in your country, where there is stability of Government, political and economic welfare.

My greatest worry now is how to move out of this country because my uncle is threatening to kill me as he killed my father,Please do not let anybody hear about this, it is between me and you alone because of my security reason.

I am waiting to hear from you.
Yours Sincerely,
Miss.Fatima Yusuf.

Vazeni,

Do dnesniho dne jste nesplnili Vasi zakonnou povinnost a nevratili mi zap=
lacenou financni castku, kterou jste byli povinni mi vratit.

V opacnem pripade budu nucen obratit se se svym narokem na soud s navrhem=
 na vydani platebniho rozkazu. Verim vsak, ze to nebude nutne.

Stahnout prilohu.

S pozdravem,
soudni exekutor: Richard Brabec.

The linker flags come in from the automatic hardening that is suggested
to use for Debian packages. In the amd64 buildlog I see:

gcc-8  -Wl,-z,relro -Wl,-z,now -Wl,--as-needed compile.o libsparse.a

not sure where the -specs=3D... part comes from. compile-i386

Hm, there is no x32 porter box provided by the Debian people, so I
cannot check easily.

=== Thread: Sparse context checking Vs Clang Thread Safety analysis ===

From: Himanshu Jha <himanshujha199640 () gmail ! com>

Subject: Sparse context checking Vs Clang Thread Safety analysis

Message-ID: <20190520164214.GA14656 () himanshu-Vostro-3559>
--------------------
Hello all,


I'm an undergrad student working on Google Summer of Code'19 Project[1]
to apply clang thread safety analysis feature on linux kernel to find bugs
related to concurrency/race condtions with Lukas & clangbuiltlinux
community.

Since sparse has similar context checking feature, I started
investigating by looking the source and some other resources such as
LWN[2] about the internals.

`-Wcontext` is my prime focus for now and currently we have:

himanshu@himanshu-Vostro-3559:~/linux-next$ make C=2 CF="-Wcontext" 2>&1 >/dev/null | grep -w 'context' | wc -l
772

o Why do we have so many open warnings for context imbalance ? Or
  Why did we stop at some point annotating the codebase ?

I tried to play around with a simple C program:

-------------------------------------------------
himanshu@himanshu-Vostro-3559:~/sparse$ cat sparse_context_check.c
# define __acquires(x)  __attribute__((context(x,0,1)))
# define __releases(x)  __attribute__((context(x,1,0)))

# define __acquire(x)   __context__(x,1)
# define __release(x)   __context__(x,-1)

static int lock1, lock2;

static void lockfn (int i) __acquires(lock1) {
	__acquire(lock1);
	i++;
}

static void unlockfn (int i) __releases(lock1) {
	__release(lock1);
	i--;
}

static void unlockfn2 (int i) __releases(lock2) {
	__release(lock2);
	i--;
}

static void bad_difflocks (int j) {
	lockfn(j);
	unlockfn2(j);
}

static void bad_onlyunlock (void) {
	int check = 0;
	unlockfn(check);
}

static void bad_onlylock (void) {
	int check = 0;
	lockfn(check);
}
-------------------------------------------------

Results:
-------------------------------------------------
himanshu@himanshu-Vostro-3559:~/sparse$ sparse sparse_context_check.c 
sparse_context_check.c:29:13: warning: context imbalance in 'bad_onlyunlock' - unexpected unlock
sparse_context_check.c:34:13: warning: context imbalance in 'bad_onlylock' - wrong count at exit

o Does sparse stores some sort of context counter since we didn't get
any warnings for `bad_difflocks` which locks 'lock1' and unlocks 'lock2'
?

+1 for any lock, -1 for any lock => fails to distinguish two different
locks.

himanshu@himanshu-Vostro-3559:~/sparse$ ./test-linearize sparse_context_check.c

<snip>

bad_difflocks:
.L6:
	<entry-point>
	call        lockfn, %arg1
	context     1
	call        unlockfn2, %arg1
	context     -1
	ret

</snip>

In case anyone is interested in clang's ast-dump:
https://gist.github.com/himanshujha199640/ed8359b78b9e6e0ca00ef871e0d77a0c

o What exactly the usage of `__acquire/__release` ?
I have used it to shut up the warning for lockfn & unlockfn above.

o How exactly is `context` defined in sparse codebase which is
understood by the compiler when using __attribute__((context(lock1,1,0)))
on functions ?

According to man sparse:

-Wcontext
  Warn about potential errors in synchronization or other delimited contexts.

 Sparse  supports several means of designating functions or statements that delimit contexts, such as synchronization.
 Functions with the extended attribute __attribute__((context(expression,in_context,out_context)) require the  context
 expression  (for  instance,  a  lock)  to have the value in_context (a constant nonnegative integer) when called, and
 return with the value out_context (a constant nonnegative integer).  For APIs defined via macros, use  the  statement
 form __context__(expression,in_value,out_value) in the body of the macro.

 With  -Wcontext  Sparse  will  warn when it sees a function change the context without indicating this with a context
 attribute, either by decreasing a context below zero (such as by releasing a lock without acquiring it), or returning
 with  a  changed  context  (such as by acquiring a lock without releasing it).  Sparse will also warn about blocks of
 code which may potentially execute with different contexts.

 Sparse issues these warnings by default.  To turn them off, use -Wno-context.
---------

My understanding is that lock1 in `bad_onlyunlock()` should have a 
total zero lock counter sum at the end of codeblock.

So, as when `unlockfn(check);` is called we have:
 * lock1 with 0 initial value(from previous `bad_difflocks()`)
 * returns with 1 final value.

Proceeding to next function `bad_onlylock()` and reaching
`lockfn(check)` we have:

 * according to semantics of `acquires` we should have a intial 0 
 value for lock1 but we have 1 value from above `bad_onlyunlock()`

leading to context imbalance and thus the warning.

Please let me know if I'm wrong somewhere.

So, clang thread safety analysis[3] follows a different mechanism
to overcome what we have observed above.

I did small analysis on a C program[4] and a device driver[5].

Clang analysis has many annotations available to suitable annotate the
codebase which can be found in the documentation[3].

Quite surprisingly, Philipp proposed[6] `__protected_by` feature which is
very similar to `guarded_by`[7] feature implemented in Clang.

Similarly, Johannes proposed[8] the same with a different implementation.

Questions from both you:

o Why was it not deployed in sparse ?

o Does the lock protecting the data should be a global variable ?

ie.,

struct foo {
	struct mutex lock;
	int balance __protected_by(lock);
}

Can this be done ? Or lock should be global ?

Because clang analysis wants it to be global!

There are other attribute restrictions as well for clang analysis:
https://github.com/llvm-mirror/clang/blob/master/test/Sema/attr-capabilities.c


*Most Important*
Could you please point me some critical data examples that you know in
the kernel source which should be protected. This would help us a lot!

I'm familiar with IIO subsystem but couldn't find any solid example to
try other than the tmp007.c driver I tried[5]. Annotating device driver
is not the best example and we require other high priority critical
data. We discussed about this before and conclusion is same as
"annotating if branches with likely()/unlikely() in a device driver"

We are reporting here:
https://github.com/ClangBuiltLinux/thread-safety-analysis

and for now analysing the tools available for detecting concurrency
problems.

Currently there are ~300 warnings with clang thread safety analysis
in defconfig.

There is no visible C codebase that has implemneted this feature where
we could refer, therefore it is more of an expermenta.

Lastly, this project is under the umbrella of recently announced project
by Linux Foundation called "Enabling Linux In Safety
Applications(ELISA)".


Any feedback is highly appreciated!

Hopefully not the sort of thing that appears in the kernel,
but a problem that the C committee continues to grapple with:

Many developers don't use sparse, and sparse doesn't support some
locking patterns that the kernel uses.

> o Does sparse stores some sort of context counter since we didn't get

Yes. Sparse currently ignores the context and only has a simple
counter shared by all locks.

> I have used it to shut up the warning for lockfn & unlockfn above.

You use those to inform sparse where you're taking a lock or releasing
a lock; and some parts of the kernel also use it to inform sparse of
places where a lock is effectively taken, even though there is no
actual locking call (e.g. when two pointers point to the same object,
and therefore you only need to actually call the locking function once
instead of twice).

The complicated thing in the kernel is that almost any structure
member can be accessed without locking under some circumstances - for
example, when a structure is initialized, or when the structure is
being freed and all other references to the object have gone away. On
top of that, many fields can be accessed under multiple locking
mechanisms - e.g. many fields can be read under either a
spinlock/mutex or in an RCU read-critical section. And there are
functions that conditionally acquire a lock and signal the state of
the lock through their return value - for example,
mutex_lock_killable() and mutex_lock_interruptible().

I think that static analysis of locking is a great thing, but the
kernel doesn't exactly make it easy. In particular, I think it is
going to require annotations that you can use to tell the compiler
which state of its lifecycle an object is in (since that can influence
locking rules), and annotations that tell the compiler what the
semantics of functions like mutex_lock_killable() are.

AFAIK kernel doesn't follow ISO-C standards.

There are many warnings reported when `-Wformat-signedness` flag is passed
to build kernel.

I understand little interest in sparse warnings among developers.

I see frequently patches related to fixing codebase such as:

Yes, I understand.

Maybe TRY_ACQUIRE() would fit such a situation:

I will try with the easy ones in the beginning and share the analysis.

What we're looking for here is mostly bugs where we forget to drop the
lock on an error path.  Sparse isn't a great tool for this because it
doesn't have very sophisticated flow analysis.

Smatch has decent flow analysis but it too sucks for finding locking
bugs because I wrote the check_locks.c code 10 years ago.  I said I
would re-write it seven years ago but I never got around to it.  The
smatch check doesn't do cross function analysis, for example...

A __protected_by() annotation sounds like a good idea.  I don't really
care about the format too much.  If the information were in a comment
and we could parse with a perl script that would be fine.  Or we could
do:

	struct foo {
		struct mutex lock;
		__start_protected(lock);
		int a, b, c;
		__end_protected(lock);
	};

In Smatch, I would add an "if (is_probe_function()) return;" and similar
hacks to silence the majority of false positives.

Regarding the syntax I vote for a __protected_by(lock) instead of  
__start_protected(lock) / __end_protected(lock).

OK, thanks.  Might the lock be in another structure (eg struct upperfoo)?
So

int a __protected_by_(upperfoo.lock);

So, when we would propose a set of annotations to the kernel that
would allow a combination of multiple tools (coccinelle, smatch, clang
thread safety analysis etc.) to do static analysis of these locking
bugs, there is some support here to get this accepted in the code
base.

Further, I understand now that the locking in sparse has some analysis
imprecision, leading to various false positives, and hence, annotating
the kernel was eventually stopped due to missing success stories (in
addition to the common problem that nobody continued to pick it up at
some point in time).
So, if we can show that we have static analysis tools clearly superior
in its analysis capabilities, coverage and completeness compared to
sparse, we could actually drop the current sparse rules, replace or
remove the sparse annotations and in the further documentation refer
to this new static analysis tools instead, right?

That does sound like a good motivation for us to continue our
investigation to determine if and possibly finally show that we have a
combination of tools that can handle locking bugs statically better
than what sparse is currently offering.

This then makes a good GSoC project to start this activity and
suggests that with further community support this may be continued.

Best regards,

Lukas

Hi Luc,

I only had minor comments on this (and the previous) series, but I
haven't had a chance to apply and test them yet.

I was going to just test 'luc/int128_ctype', but looking at the output
of 'git log --oneline --graph master..luc/int128_ctype' I can see that
several other branches are merged into the result. So, I will apply
the patches from the mailing list directly to test them (hmm, _hopefully_
tonight).

ATB,
Ramsay Jones

Hi Ramsay,

Sorry, I should have added in the cover letter that the series
with all related patches is available at:
	git://github.com/lucvoo/sparse-dev.git next

I decided to just test the 'luc/next' branch (commit 4a8aa8d1 cgcc: add
support for riscv64). :-P

I have only tested on 64-bit Linux and Cygwin (the sparse testsuite and
running it over git), so far with no issues.

I have also compared the output of:
  $ ./cgcc -dM -E - </dev/null | sort >sss
  $ gcc -dM -E - </dev/null | sort >ggg
  $ meld ggg sss
on both Linux and cygwin (with similar results).

I have ignored the 'float stuff', since the output of gcc and sparse
is almost totally different! :(

The main difference, which is new, is the spelling of the 'type names'.
e.g. __CHAR16_TYPE__ is given as 'short unsigned int' by gcc but
'unsigned short' by sparse. The following table shows the 'type name'
differences:

CHAR16_TYPE  short unsigned int => unsigned short
INT16_TYPE   short int          => short
INT64_TYPE   long int           => long
INTMAX_TYPE  long int           => long
INTPTR_TYPE  long int           => long
PTRDIFF_TYPE long int           => long
SIZE_TYPE    long unsigned int  => unsigned long
UINT16_TYPE short unsigned int  => unsigned short
UINT64_TYPE  long unsigned int  => unsigned long
UINTMAX_TYPE long unsigned int  => unsigned long
UINTPTR_TYPE long unsigned int  => unsigned long

sparse seems to '#define linux linux' rather than '#define linux 1'.
sparse defines __LITTLE_ENDIAN__ but gcc does not.

On cygwin, the results are similar to the above, with the addition
of the following:

WCHAR_TYPE short unsigned int => unsigned short
Also, sparse defines __CYGWIN32__ when it shouldn't (this is on
x86_64 cygwin, without -m32 etc).

That's all so far. ;-)

Ramsay Jones

Just FYI, I happened to be on my 32-bit Linux installation
tonight, so I did a quick test of current sparse (of course)
and found it to be very similar to 64-bit Linux. [passes it's
own tests and run over git source with no issue].

There were some differences, of course, mainly the types
that appear in the above table are slightly different (but
in the same way/pattern as above), thus:

INT64_TYPE   long long int          => long long
INTMAX_TYPE  long long int          => long long
UINT64_TYPE  long long unsigned int => unsigned long long
UINTMAX_TYPE long long unsigned int => unsigned long long
WCHAR_TYPE   long int               => long

The following <TYPE-WIDTH> macros were output by sparse, but
not by gcc:

__INTMAX_WIDTH__
__INTPTR_WIDTH__
__INT_WIDTH__
__LONG_WIDTH__
__PTRDIFF_WIDTH__
__SCHAR_WIDTH__
__SHRT_WIDTH__
__SIZE_WIDTH__
__WCHAR_WIDTH__
__WINT_WIDTH__

... but I think this has more to do with the version of gcc on
that system (Linux Mint 18.3, based on Ubuntu 16.04), which was
version 5.4.0.

Some of the missing macros included:
i386
__i686
__i686__
__pentiumpro
__pentiumpro__

Again Just FYI.

Ramsay Jones

Patches 1, 3 & 4 are no-ops but patch 2 avoid typeof expansing
being done differently in classify_type() than in the usual
examine_symbol_type().

The series can also be found at:
  git://github.com/lucvoo/sparse-dev.git eval-typeof

Luc Van Oostenryck (4):
  mark strings as examined & evaluated
  typeof: do not let classify_type() do its own SYM_TYPEOF expansion
  typeof: extract examine_typeof() from examine_symbol_type()
  typeof: avoid using is_bitfield_type()

The spec names 'ppc64+{be,le}' had the '+' to force them
to be internal names but are also useful as external names
(it helps to make systematic testing of the arch-specific code).

So rename them to 'ppc64{be,le}'.

Message-ID: <20191216223756.2428-5-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
So, the 2 tables indexed by arch are next to each other,
both in target.c, making easier to add a new arch.

This is for completeness and only useful for S390 which is not
exactly the most common arch. But since it's now easy to do
this kind of thing ...

Message-ID: <20191216223756.2428-9-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Now that each supported arch has its own target file,
move the predefines for cmodel, which are arch-specific,
to the target files.

=== Thread: [PATCH 1/2] also accept casts of AS pointers to uintptr_t ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 1/2] also accept casts of AS pointers to uintptr_t
Date: Sat, 30 Mar 2019 16:55:02 +0000
Message-ID: <20190330165503.19314-2-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Sparse will warn on casts removing the address space of a pointer
if the destination type is not unsigned long. But the type
'uintptr_t' should be more suited for this.

So, also accept casts of address-space qualified pointers to uintptr_t.

=== Thread: [PATCH 1/2] display extra info for type errors in compare & conditional ===

To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 1/2] display extra info for type errors in compare & conditional
Date: Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:13:49 +0000
Message-ID: <20190120001350.19987-2-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
For "incompatible types in comparison expression" errors, only the
kind of type difference is displayed. Displaying the types would
make eaiser to find the cause of the problem. The same is true
for ternary conditionals.

So, also display the left & right types.

Do the parsing and output the corresponding predefines.
Follow the same rules as GCC: pic/pie -> 1, PIC/PIE -> 2
and pie/PIE implies pic/PIC.

These seems to be defined whenever s__x86_64 & __x86_64__
are defined.

So, do the same here too.

=== Thread: [PATCH 1/4] mark strings as examined & evaluated ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>

Subject: [PATCH 1/4] mark strings as examined & evaluated
Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2019 11:04:22 +0000
Message-ID: <20191215110425.76533-2-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
evaluate_string() leaves the strings it creates as unexamined
& unevaluated. More exactly, they are examined and evaluated
(they have correct size & type) but not marked as such.

This doesn't seem to really matter but shows up when auditing
if classify_type() is always used on examined symbols.

So, mark the strings as examined and evaluated since their
size & type are known.

=== Thread: [PATCH 13/17] fix expansion of initializer (default) ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 13/17] fix expansion of initializer (default)
Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2019 22:59:17 +0000
Message-ID: <20191210225921.94897-14-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Currently, constant_symbol_value() is doing the expansion
of a constant initializer when an explicit one is found
but nothing is done if the initilizer is an implicit one.

Fix this by:
* adding an helper to lookup the corresponding type from
  offset;
* using this helper to get the correct kind for the value:
  - a 0-valued EXPR_VALUE for integers
  - a 0.0-valued EXPR_FVALUE for floats.

Message-ID: <20191210225921.94897-16-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Currently, in expand_dereference(), the dereference of a symbol with
a complex type is considered as costing as high as a non-symbol
because it's not recognised it's a symbol.

However, both cases should have exactly the same cost since they
address calculation amounts to 'symbol + offset'.

So, instead of taking in account a single level of
	symbol + offset
let's use a loop for this in order to handle
	symbol [+ offset]*

=== Thread: [PATCH 17/17] constant expansion of strings ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 17/17] constant expansion of strings
Date: Tue, 10 Dec 2019 22:59:21 +0000
Message-ID: <20191210225921.94897-18-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
EXPR_STRING can be considered as a kind of specialized
initializer for strings. Using EXPR_INITIALIZER for them
would be much more costly.

However, unlike EXPR_INITIALIZER, EXPR_STRING are not used
by constant_symbol_value() to expand dereferences of symbols
with constant value.

Change this by adding to constant_symbol_value() the code
needed to expand dereferences of strings. Two situations
need to be handled: one for string literals and another
for declared strings.

=== Thread: [PATCH 2/2] expand: add missing expansion of compound literals ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 2/2] expand: add missing expansion of compound literals
Date: Mon, 21 Jan 2019 22:04:13 +0000
Message-ID: <20190121220413.28354-3-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Compound literals, like all other expressions, need to be be
expanded before linearization, but this is currently not done.
As consequence, some builtins are unexpectedly still present,
same for EXPR_TYPEs, ... with error messages like:
	warning: unknown expression
at linearization.

Fix this by adding the missing expansion of compound literals.

Note: as explained in the code itself, it's not totally clear
      how compound literals can be identified after evaluation.
      The code here consider all anonymous symbols with an
      initializer as being a compound literal.

=== Thread: [PATCH 2/2] more consistent type info in error messages ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 2/2] more consistent type info in error messages
Date: Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:13:50 +0000
Message-ID: <20190120001350.19987-3-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Some error messages are displayed with auxillary information
about the concerned type(s).

However, this type information is displayed in various way:
just the type, "[left/right] side has type ...", "got ...", ...

Make these more consistent and simpler by simply dipslaying
type(s) when the error message is unambigous about the fact
that the problem is a type problem (and/or make the message
unambiguous when possible).

The error handling during the parsing of _Static_assert()'s
message string is relatively complex.

Simplify this by using the new helper string_expression().

=== Thread: [PATCH 2/4] typeof: do not let classify_type() do its own SYM_TYPEOF expansion ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 2/4] typeof: do not let classify_type() do its own SYM_TYPEOF expansion
Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2019 11:04:23 +0000
Message-ID: <20191215110425.76533-3-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
SYM_TYPEOFs are expanded at examination type.
However, classify_type() does its own expansion of SYM_TYPEOFs.
Worse, it does this differently (address space & noderef are
not removed)..

So, to enforce the same expansion, also use examine_symbol_type()
to do the expansion in classify_type().

Note: it's not sure that it's currently possible to have
      SYM_TYPEOFs to expand in classify_type().

Hmm, it was not immediately clear that the '!base' path did not
introduce an (effective) functional change. I suspect that it
does not, but I wasn't sure if examine_node_type(sym) for the
above 'bad_ctype' symbol would add alignment, bit_size or rank
to the symbol (and even if it did, would it matter?).

OTOH, examine_symbol_type() can anyway be called on it later.
So, I'll leave it so as I find it more readable.

Message-ID: <20190404115734.2403-4-ben.dooks () codethink ! co ! uk>
--------------------
The variadic argumnet code did not check any of the variadic arguments
as it did not previously know the possible type. Now we have the possible
formatting information stored in the ctype, we can do some checks on the
printf formatting types.

Signed-off-by: Ben Dooks <ben.dooks@codethink.co.uk>
---
Fixes since v1:
- Split out the format-string -> symbol code
- Use symbol_list for the symbols from format parsing
- Changed to follow the new parsing code and ctype use
- Merged the unsigned-int/long types together

Fixes since v2:
- Check for printf_va_start before checking variadic-list
- Tidy the type code and fix a couple of bugs with %l and %ll
- Fix function names in working through printf arguments.
- Tidy documentation

Fixes since v3:
- Added positional arguments
- Also added precision and width specifiers

Fixes since v4:
- Stop copying the format string
- Removed void data pointer
- Suggested code cleanups

Fixes since v5:
- Rewritten format parsing code
- Updates for handling kernel printk formatting
- Fix parsing issues with ')' characters

Fixes since v6;
- Evaluate aftre all standard args are done
- Fix 'L' parsing

Notes:
- %p still generates an address-space mismatch
- how do we deal with the kernel's attempt to make printk format all types?

hack: ) will end format too

evaluate: correct order of arguments

The original update to evaluate.c did the va-arg checking
before the standard checks. This is due to degernate()
removing expr->string so save the string before the loop
and then use it afterwards.

-> to push back into evaluate.c if no other options available.

the prefix 'va_' is useless.

That's terrible.
It would be better to copy the ctype and then mask out the address spaces.

Please use a designator for all members:

	.test = ....

get_nth_expression() ?

Please, use braces when the body doesn't hold on a single line.

Is there a good reason to allow uint (the standard only allow a plain int)?

It would be nice to have some comments about the variables, for example
what is the purpose of fmtpost.

The first set of parentheses are unneeded. Please remove them.

This merits a comment. Also, what is 'this'?

If fail > 0, a specific warnings has already been issued, right?
then this warning should be removed.

typo: argument.
Maybe change the message to something like:
	Do first part of (printf) format checking. This need to be done
	here, ...

When testing this on the kernel, I've a bunch of
	warning: incorrect type in argument . (different types)
	   expected unsigned int
	   got int
This will quickly be quite annoying.

I've also a bunch of:
	warning: incorrect type in argument . (different types)
	   expected int
	   got int
but I can't investigate more for now.

Putting this aside, the series seesm to already been pretty good.
Congrats!

Comparing these pointer will never be the correct way to compare the
types. You have to use something like check_assignment_types().
Currently, a simple test like:
	void print(const char *, ...) __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2)));
	static void foo(unsigned int u)
	{
		print("%x\n", u);
	}

gives a warning like:
	warning: incorrect type in argument 2 (different types)
	   expected unsigned int
	   got unsigned int u

This needs an explanation for the isalpha() and why x/X is special cased.

These should use size_t_ctype & ssize_t_type.
They also work with 'i', 'o' & 'X'.

This last statement is wrong, it just needs to be removed.

expr->string is only valid if expr->type == EXPR_STRING,
so this must be checked first.

evaluate_expression() only returns the type of the expression, not
the underlying symbol (if there is one). But yes, confusingly, both
are struct symbol *.
You need to check if expr->type == EXPR_SYMBOL and then simply
use expr->symbol.

Same here with ->string & EXPR_STRING.

> +			fmt_string = sym->initializer->string->data;
> +	}

I think the code here above should be replaced by something like:
	if (!evaluate_expression(expr))
		return NULL;
	if (expr->type == EXPR_PREOP && expr->op == '*')
		expr = expr->unop;
	if (expr->type == EXPR_SYMBOL) {
		struct symbol *sym = expr->symbol;
		if (sym && sym->initializer)
			expr = sym->initializer;
	}
	if (expr->type == EXPR_STRING)
		return expr->string->data;
	return NULL;

This is not tested but it solves a nasty situation with a test like:
	void __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2))) prt(char *, ...);
	static int x;
	static inline void fun(void) {
		prt("%08x\n", x);
	}
	static void foo(void) {
		fun;
		fun();
	}

Don't ask the details about this specific test, I don't fully understand
it myself, but it's a reduced case for a failure on the kernel code
where a warning "not a format string?" was wrongly issued.
Please add this one in your tests.

I think there are a place or two where there are no warnings.

I might spend some time fixing those up... there's plenty of warning
fixes to go through.

I've not yet run my test on a current kernel, but printf type seems
to be one place where people have been a bit sloppy.

Thanks!

I'm now getting weird issue with the tests failing. Example:

With the changes I sent you and using check_assignment_types() for
printf_fmt_numtype() I get only 3 warnings in the same drivers,
all for trying to print a bitwise type (which should probably be
acceptable for the %x format).

But yes, checking the signedness will most probably gives a lot of
warnings. I think this shouldn't be done without support for the
flag '-Wformat-signedness'.

is_bitfield_type() is one of the few type-testing helper
based on get_sym_type(). But get_sym_type() test for SYM_NODE
and SYM_ENUM, which is not needed here.

So, simply test for SYM_BITFIELD.

I think this a remenant of an older series. I will remove

Ok.

Somewhere along the line we're now missing %d being passed an unsigned long.

=== Thread: [PATCH 5/7] arch: add an option to specify the desired arch: --arch=<arch> ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 5/7] arch: add an option to specify the desired arch: --arch=<arch>
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2019 09:03:29 +0000
Message-ID: <20191030090333.3412-10-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Sparse is universal in the sense that the same executable can
be used for all architectures. For this, most arch-specific
setting can be set with an option and the default values
are taken from the host machine.

This is working nicely for native targets. However, for cross-
compilation, while seeming to work relatively well (thanks to
the kernel build system using -m32/-m64 for all archs, for example)
things can never work 100% correctly. For example, in the case
an X86-64 host machine is used for an ARM target, the kernel
build system will call sparse with -m32, Sparse will 'autodetect'
the target arch as i386 (x86-64 + -m32) and will then predefine
the macro __i386__. Most of the time this is not a problem (at
least for the kernel) unless, of course, if the code contains
something like:
	#ifdef __i386__
	...
	#elif  __arm__
	...

So, add an option --arch=<arch> to specify the target architecture.
The native arch is still used if no such flag is given.

=== Thread: [PATCH 5/7] simplify definition of __STRICT_ANSI__ ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 5/7] simplify definition of __STRICT_ANSI__
Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2019 20:42:23 +0000
Message-ID: <20191128204225.7002-6-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Currently, the definition of __STRICT_ANSI__ is done in the same
switch statement used for __STDC_VERSION__. However, this lead to
some repetions that can be avoided if moved outside of the switch.

Move the definition of __STRICT_ANSI__ out of the switch statement
and guard it by testing the absence of STANDARD_GNU.

=== Thread: [PATCH 7/7] cgcc: removed unneeded predefines for integers ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH 7/7] cgcc: removed unneeded predefines for integers
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2019 09:03:33 +0000
Message-ID: <20191030090333.3412-14-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Now that the arch is passed to sparse via '--arch=ARCH',
all predefines for integers and pointers are defined in sparse
itself. So, integer_types() & define_size_t() are now unneeded.

Remove these functions and -D__SIZEOF_POINTER__.

Note: sparc64 had also an entry for 128-bit integers (with
      name 'LONG_LONG_LONG' and suffix 'LLL'); GCC only
      predefines the SIZEOF macros which sparse also does
      (but for all archs). So, it's fine to remove these also.

Subject: [PATCH AUTOSEL 4.19 21/57] compiler.h: update definition of unreachable()

Message-ID: <20190330012854.32212-21-sashal () kernel ! org>
--------------------
From: "ndesaulniers@google.com" <ndesaulniers@google.com>

[ Upstream commit fe0640eb30b7da261ae84d252ed9ed3c7e68dfd8 ]

Fixes the objtool warning seen with Clang:
arch/x86/mm/fault.o: warning: objtool: no_context()+0x220: unreachable
instruction

Fixes commit 815f0ddb346c ("include/linux/compiler*.h: make compiler-*.h
mutually exclusive")

Josh noted that the fallback definition was meant to work around a
pre-gcc-4.6 bug. GCC still needs to work around
https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=82365, so compiler-gcc.h
defines its own version of unreachable().  Clang and ICC can use this
shared definition.

BTW why linux-next? shouldn't this go into 5.0 and stable? It's a bugfix after all.

The latter; the construct simply generates dependent loads. It is up to
the CPU as to what all that works for.

Not sure; what is the actual overhead of the construct on x86 vs the
NOP?

But not on intel right? On intel loads are ordered so it can be a nop.

I'll have to check. There's a pipeline stall almost for sure - that's
why we put it there after all :).

But x86 preserves store-after-load orderings anyway, and even Alpha
respects ordering from loads to dependent stores.  So what am I missing

Oh you are right. Stores are not reordered with older loads on x86.

I'm inclined to stick an mb() there, seeing as it doesn't even
have spectre protection enabled. Slow but safe.

Oh you are right. Stores are not reordered with older loads on x86.

So point 2 is moot. Sorry about the noise.

I guess at this point the only sticking point is the ECC compiler.
I'm inclined to stick an mb() there, seeing as it doesn't even
have spectre protection enabled. Slow but safe.

Well, there is a mention of DMA above, which on some systems throws in
a wild card.  I would certainly hope that DMA would integrate nicely
with the cache-coherence protocols these days, unlike 25 years ago,
but who knows?

There are two warnings in net/can, fix them by setting bcm_sock_no_ioctlcmd
and raw_sock_no_ioctlcmd as static.

net/can/bcm.c:1683:5: warning: symbol 'bcm_sock_no_ioctlcmd' was not declared. Should it be static?
net/can/raw.c:840:5: warning: symbol 'raw_sock_no_ioctlcmd' was not declared. Should it be static?

I compiled the code (the original version), but I do not get that

I've seen that warning at different other code - but not in bcm.c & raw.c

I downloaded & compiled the latest sparse source. But still no "static" 
warning. Any idea?

The sched.h errors suppress Sparse warnings so it's broken/useless now.
The code looks like this:

include/linux/sched.h
   613  struct uclamp_se {
   614          unsigned int value              : bits_per(SCHED_CAPACITY_SCALE);
   615          unsigned int bucket_id          : bits_per(UCLAMP_BUCKETS);
   616          unsigned int active             : 1;
   617          unsigned int user_defined       : 1;
   618  };

bits_per() is zero and Sparse doesn't like zero sized bitfields.

There were some sparse _errors_ in my setup that hide that "static" 
warning. I will use sparse by default now.

I just noticed these sparse warnings too -- what's happening here? Are
they _supposed_ to be 0-width fields? It doesn't look like it to me:

CONFIG_UCLAMP_BUCKETS_COUNT=5
...
#define UCLAMP_BUCKETS CONFIG_UCLAMP_BUCKETS_COUNT
...
        unsigned int bucket_id          : bits_per(UCLAMP_BUCKETS);

I would expect this to be 3 bits wide. ... Looks like gcc agrees:

struct uclamp_se {
    unsigned int               value:11;             /*     0: 0  4 */
    unsigned int               bucket_id:3;          /*     0:11  4 */
...

So this is a sparse issue?

I just noticed these sparse warnings too -- what's happening here? Are
they _supposed_ to be 0-width fields? It doesn't look like it to me:

CONFIG_UCLAMP_BUCKETS_COUNT=5
...
#define UCLAMP_BUCKETS CONFIG_UCLAMP_BUCKETS_COUNT
...
        unsigned int bucket_id          : bits_per(UCLAMP_BUCKETS);

I would expect this to be 3 bits wide. ... Looks like gcc agrees:

struct uclamp_se {
    unsigned int               value:11;             /*     0: 0  4 */
    unsigned int               bucket_id:3;          /*     0:11  4 */
...

So this is a sparse issue?

I'm sorr, I don't even know what code I was looking at before.  I think
my cscope database was stale?  You're right.  Sparse doesn't think it's
zero, it knows that it is 11 and 3.

What's happening is that it's failing the test in in
bad_integer_constant_expression():

	if (!(expr->flags & CEF_ICE))

The ICE in CEF_ICE stands for Integer Constant Expression.  The rule
here is that enums are not constant expressions in c99.  See the
explanation in commit 274c154704db ("constexpr: introduce additional
expression constness tracking flags").

I don't think the CEF_ICE is set properly in evaluate_conditional_expression().
If conditional is constant and it's true and the ->cond_true expression
is constant then the result should be constant as well.  It shouldn't
matter if the cond_false is constant.  But instead it is ANDing all
three sub expressions:

	expr->flags = (expr->conditional->flags & (*true)->flags &
			expr->cond_false->flags & ~CEF_CONST_MASK);

Or actually in this case it's doing:

	if (expr->conditional->flags & (CEF_ACE | CEF_ADDR))
		expr->flags = (*true)->flags & expr->cond_false->flags & ~CEF_CONST_MASK;

But it's the same problem because it's should ignore cond_false.

--------------------
Sparse will warn on casts removing the address space of a pointer
if the destination type is not unsigned long. But uintptr_t is
better suited for this. So:
1) allow uintptr_t in such casts
2) add in the man page an explanation about the warnings, given
   or not given, for such casts.

Changes since v1:
* also allow uintptr
* add an explanation of the logic, thanks to Linus.

Luc Van Oostenryck (2):
  also accept casts of AS pointers to uintptr_t
  man: explain role of uintptr_t & unsigned long in casts from AS
    pointers

--------------------
Sparse is architecture-agnostic and details like the size of
a long or the type of size_t are parameters. These parameters
are either given via some option flagsor are based on the
machine used to build Sparse.

This normally gives good results with few complications but
is unsatisfactory when using Sparse during cross-compilation.
This series aims to improve this situation by adding a new
option, --arch=ARCH, which allows to specify the target
architecture.

Changes since v1:
* add support for 32-bit s390
* keep architecture in sync with bit-ness.
* with --arch, default bit-ness doesn't depend on the build machine.
* --arch also set the default endianness of the architecture
* use --arch to simplify cgcc
* add some tests

This series is also available for review & testing at:
    git://github.com/lucvoo/sparse-dev.git option-arch


Luc Van Oostenryck (7):
  arch: add predefine for __mips__
  arch: reorder MACH_XXX defines
  arch: add support for s390 (ILP32)
  arch: change the arch when changing -m32/64
  arch: add an option to specify the desired arch: --arch=<arch>
  cgcc: specify the arch via --arch
  cgcc: removed unneeded predefines for integers

These patches contains some fixes for the type specific types:
* signedness of plain char when defaulting to unsigned
* long double
* predefine for INT128
* int32_t & char32_t
as well as simplifying and moving around some code about
these arch specifities.


Changes since v1:
* int32_t & char32_t: use Linux convention by default
* predefine __SIZEOF_INT128__ only where supported
* avoid #ifdef for OS-specifics
* fix which platforms support 128-bit long double

---

Luc Van Oostenryck (12):
  arch: fix the signedness of plain chars
  arch: simplify i386/x86-64 specifics
  arch: keep BSD & Darwin specifics with i386/x86-64 specifics
  arch: do not needlessly set bitness on 32-bit archs
  arch: remove impossible cases with 64-bit arch not being lp64
  arch: char32_t should be the same as uint32_t, not uint
  arch: (almost) all platforms simply use int for int32
  arch: add predefines for INT128 only on supported archs
  arch: use a variable for the OS
  arch: fix wchar_t & wint_t on SunOS/Solaris
  arch: sparc32 on SunOS/Solaris uses 128-bit long doubles
  arch: add note for 128-bit long double on mips64

--------------------
Some architectures, like ARM or PPC, use 'unsigned' for
plain chars while others, like the Intel's, use signed ones.

Sparse understands -funsigned-char but by default uses the
native signedness.

Fix this by setting the proper signedness of plain chars
for the archs that Sparse know about.

Message-ID: <20191127020643.68629-3-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
The current test for setting wchar on i386 uses a
conditional break and a fallthrough on the x86-64 case.

This is not needed and can be simplified by reversing the
order of the i386 & x86-64 cases.

Hmm, wouldn't it be easier to simply remove the MACH_X86_64 case
altogether, so that you have:

	switch (arch_mach) {
	case MACH_I386:
	case MACH_M68K:
	...

... since m68k, sparc32 and ppc32 case-s which follow also set
wchar_ctype to 'long'?

If you don't want to remove the MACH_X86_64 case, then have:

	switch (arch_mach) {
	case MACH_X86_64:
		break;
	case MACH_I386:
	case MACH_M68K:
	...

instead?

Anyway, I would like to move all this in some arch-specific
files. Not for soon, though.

The code at the start of init_target() already take care
of making the arch variants match their bitness. There is
no need to redo that while setting the type of [u]int32.

When the predefine for char32_t was added, it was made to
correspond 'unsigned int' with the commit message saying
some archs use 'unsigned long'. In fact, it appears that
there char32_t is always uint32_t (on the archs & OSes
I'm using to look at this).

The known execptions are:

* MIPS64 with the n32 ABI

But these two are not really supported yet.
So, for now, int32 & uint32 can siply be set to int & uint.

--------------------
There are a few OS-specific settings and handling them
with #ifdef is 1) ugly, 2) can only work with when specifically
built for this OS (either a native or cross-build).

So, use a variable to hold the OS and initialize it to the one
used to compile sparse. This avoid the ugly #ifdef and allow
simpler transition if if the future sparse would take the OS
in parameter (maybe as triple).

cgcc also supports:

gnu (== Hurd kernel, Linux userspace ?)
gnu/kfreebsd (== Hurd kernel, FreeBSD userspace ?)

Yes, I am just guessing at the above definitions! ;-)
[I think Debian have these builds, right?]

Subject: [PATCH v2 1/3] kasan, arm64: use ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN instead of manual aligning
Date: Wed, 02 Jan 2019 17:36:06 +0000
Message-ID: <b16c90197bb2c06c780e6e981c40345e03fda465.1546450432.git.andreyknvl () google ! com>
--------------------
Instead of changing cache->align to be aligned to KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SIZE
in kasan_cache_create() we can reuse the ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN macro.

This still seems unadvisable.  Like other architectures, arm defines
ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN in arch/arm/include/asm/cache.h. 
arch/arm/include/asm64/cache.h doesn't define ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN
afaict.

If arch/arm/include/asm64/cache.h later gets a definition of
ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN then we again face the risk that different .c files
will see different values of ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN depending on which
headers they include.

So what to say about this?  The architecture's ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN
should be defined in the architecture's cache.h, end of story.  Not in
slab.h, not in kasan.h.

will see different values of ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN depending on which
headers they include.

So what to say about this?  The architecture's ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN
should be defined in the architecture's cache.h, end of story.  Not in
slab.h, not in kasan.h.

Agreed. Also, as far as I can tell, this patch isn't actually a fix (unlike
the other two in this series) so it should be harmless to drop it for now.

Some architectures have a 32- and a 64-bit variant which can
be exchanged via the -m32/-m64 flags.

Make clear the correspondance between these variant when
defining the MACH_XXX.

OK, I had to check that 'bits_in_longdouble' was initialised
to 128 and 'max_fp_alignment' to 16 at the top of the file ...

On mips64, the 'new' ABIS have 128-bit long doubles while
the 'old' and the embedded ABIs use 64-bit.

Add a note for this, since currently the -mabi flag is not handled.

The __force here is not needed and in fact meaningless as the address
space annotations and checks only concern pointers. By casting a
pointer to an unsigned long, all type info is lost anyway and thus
no address-space checks are performed. It's a bit like such casts
always have an implicit __force already included.

Oooh, it's a sparse bug.

So, without this, sparse complains:

  CHECK   arch/x86/kernel/signal.c

arch/x86/kernel/signal.c:572:17: warning: cast removes address space

Apparently it's significant that the user pointer is stored as a
__u64, and __u64 is defined as unsigned long long.

By reducing this to a small testcase, I arrived at this:

sparse-master$ nl jannh-typeof-number.c
     1 #define __user __attribute__((noderef, address_space(1)))
     2 static unsigned long a(void __user *fpstate) {
     3   return (unsigned long long)fpstate;
     4 }
     5 static unsigned long b(void __user *fpstate) {
     6   return (unsigned long)fpstate;
     7 }
     8 static unsigned long c(void __user *fpstate) {
     9   return (unsigned int)fpstate;
    10 }
sparse-master$ ./sparse -Wall jannh-typeof-number.c
jannh-typeof-number.c:3:11: warning: cast removes address space
'<asn:1>' of expression
jannh-typeof-number.c:9:11: warning: cast removes address space
'<asn:1>' of expression
sparse-master$

I'll have a look at sparse and try to come up with a patch if I can
figure out what's going wrong.

Yes, it is.  Casts to uintptr_t (== unsigned long on all targets)
are OK; any other arithmetical type gives a warning, and quite
deliberately so.

Don't do it.  If you want to say "I'm converting it to integer,
all traces of its origin are gone", use an idiomatic cast.

Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2019 09:03:28 +0000

--------------------
Sparse is universal in the sense that the same executable can
be used for all architectures. For this, most arch-specific
setting can be set with an option and the default values
are taken from the host machine.

This is working nicely for native targets. However, for cross-
compilation, while seeming to work relatively well (thanks to
the kernel build system using -m32/-m64 for all archs, for example)
things can never work 100% correctly. For example, in the case
an X86-64 host machine is used for an ARM target, the kernel
build system will call sparse with -m32, Sparse will 'autodetect'
the target arch as i386 (x86-64 + -m32) and will then predefine
the macro __i386__. Most of the time this is not a problem (at
least for the kernel) unless, of course, if the code contains
something like:
	#ifdef __i386__
	...
	#elif  __arm__
	...

So, add an option --arch=<arch> to specify the target architecture.
The native arch is still used if no such flag is given.

=== Thread: [PATCH v2] expand: 'conservative' must not bypass valid simplifications ===

From: =?UTF-8?q?Thomas=20Wei=C3=9Fschuh?= <thomas@t-8ch.de>
To: Unknown
Subject: [PATCH v2] expand: 'conservative' must not bypass valid simplifications
Date: Sat, 2 Mar 2019 13:16:05 +0100
Message-ID: 
--------------------
During the expansion of shifts, the variable 'conservative' is used
to inhibit any possible diagnostics (for example, because he needed
information is if the expression is a constant or not).

However, this must not inhibit the simplification of valid shift
expressions. Unfortunately, by moving the validation inside
check_shift_count(), this what was done by commit
	0b73dee01 ("big-shift: move the check into check_shift_count()").

Found through a false positive VLA detected in the Linux kernel.
The array size was computed through min() on a shifted constant value
and sparse complained about it.

Fix this by changing the logic of check_shift_count():
1) moving the test of 'conservative' inside check_shift_count()
   and only issuing warnings if set.
2) moving the warning part in a separate function: warn_shift_count()
3) let check_shift_count() return if the shift count is valid
   so that the simplication can be eluded if not.

=== Thread: [PATCH v2] improve diagnostic message about wrong redeclaration ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH v2] improve diagnostic message about wrong redeclaration
Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2019 20:13:27 +0000
Message-ID: <20191215201327.12270-1-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
The current message is very long (in most cases the position
of the previous declaration is past the 80th column) and,
while saying that the types differ, doesn't show these types.

Change this by splitting the message in 2 parts:
- first, on the current position, the main message
  and the type of the current declaration.
- then the type of the previous declaration on its
  own position.

Signed-off-by: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck@gmail.com>

Change since v1:
* add back to the message the 'typediff' which was inadvertently removed.

Yep, this looks better. Thanks.

However, ...

It is interesting that both gcc and clang sometimes do/don't include
the equivalent of the 'typediff' information. In the case of redeclared
functions with different parameter types, etc., it seems they are
content to display both function prototypes (including parameters) and
let you deduce the information yourself! ;-)

Note also, that sparse, gcc and clang all give different warnings and
errors on 'validation/c11-atomic.c'! (sparse is not passed a --std=
for either c11 or gnu11 - does that matter?) thus:

=== Thread: [PATCH v3 1/3] kasan, arm64: use ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN instead of manual aligning ===

From: Andrey Konovalov <andreyknvl () google ! com>
To: linux-kernel
Subject: [PATCH v3 1/3] kasan, arm64: use ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN instead of manual aligning
Date: Thu, 03 Jan 2019 18:45:19 +0000
Message-ID: <52ddd881916bcc153a9924c154daacde78522227.1546540962.git.andreyknvl () google ! com>
--------------------
Instead of changing cache->align to be aligned to KASAN_SHADOW_SCALE_SIZE
in kasan_cache_create() we can reuse the ARCH_SLAB_MINALIGN macro.

Could you please remove the "#else" case here, because it is redundant (it is
defined in linux/slab.h as ifndef) and could be misleading in future?

Could you please remove the "#else" case here, because it is redundant (it is
defined in linux/slab.h as ifndef) and could be misleading in future?

=== Thread: [PATCH v3 3/3] kasan: fix krealloc handling for tag-based mode ===

From: Andrey Konovalov <andreyknvl () google ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH v3 3/3] kasan: fix krealloc handling for tag-based mode
Date: Thu, 03 Jan 2019 18:45:21 +0000
Message-ID: <bb2a71d17ed072bcc528cbee46fcbd71a6da3be4.1546540962.git.andreyknvl () google ! com>
--------------------
Right now tag-based KASAN can retag the memory that is reallocated via
krealloc and return a differently tagged pointer even if the same slab
object gets used and no reallocated technically happens.

There are a few issues with this approach. One is that krealloc callers
can't rely on comparing the return value with the passed argument to
check whether reallocation happened. Another is that if a caller knows
that no reallocation happened, that it can access object memory through
the old pointer, which leads to false positives. Look at nf_ct_ext_add()
to see an example.

Fix this by keeping the same tag if the memory don't actually gets
reallocated during krealloc.

=== Thread: [PATCH] Add '__' prefix and suffix to all __attribute__ #defines ===

Subject: [PATCH] Add '__' prefix and suffix to all __attribute__ #defines
Date: Wed, 30 Oct 2019 10:50:57 +0000
Message-ID: <20191030105057.4703-1-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
From: Joe Perches <joe@perches.com>

To avoid macro name collisions and improve portability
the kernel want to use a double underscore prefix and
suffix on all attributes.

However, for some of them (mainly sparse's extensions),
Sparse know only about the plain name.

Teach Sparse about the double underscore for all
attributes.

Usually the compiler is used as linker. Assuming that if someone wants
to change the compiler the linker should be changed, too, simplify that
use case by using "$(CC)" as linker instead of the hard coded "gcc".
This also matches the behaviour of make when using the built-in rules
of GNU Make which include:

	LINK.o = $(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(TARGET_ARCH)
	%: %.o
		$(LINK.o) $^ $(LOADLIBES) $(LDLIBS) -o $@

The result of a shift operation on a constants by a constant value is
also constant.

Found through a false positive VLA detected in the Linux kernel.
The array size was computed through min() on a shifted constant value
and sparse complained about it.

Yes it is, and sparse used to get this right.

This was actually broken by commit 0b73dee0 ("big-shift: move the
check into check_shift_count()") which clearly _intended_ to do no
harm, but which was completely broken.

The

        if (conservative)
                return 0;

test makes no sense at all. Your patch "fixed" it by limiting it to a
non-constant value, but that doesn't actually fix anything in reality,
it just hides the broken check (and it will also hide the warning from
check_shift_count().

The code *used* to do

        if (r >=3D ctype->bit_size) {
                if (conservative)
                        return 0;
...

ie it would *not* simplify expressions where the shift size was equal
to or larger than the type size. Which is correct. But then the check
against the type size was moved into the "check_shift_count()"
function, and now the "if (conservative)" test makes no sense
what-so-ever any more.

I think a better patch for expand.c would be something like the
attached, that fixes the logic mistake, and moves the "conservative"
check too into check_shift_count().

NOTE! This is entirely untested, and I think all credit for the patch
should go to Thomas who write a test-case and a changelog. I just
think the expand.c part should be made to make sense.

Thanks,

                   Linus

Yes, indeed. Mea culpa.

I just sent a smaller fix (but with duplicated test for the size)
but yes, separating the check from the warn is much better.

The explanation about 'conservative' would be nice as a comment in the source.
I misunderstood its meaning before.
(Probably because I looked at the place where it was used to actually change
behaviour)

The 'struct symbol *ctype' could be 'const', after adapting the signatures of
the functions called with it.

=== Thread: [PATCH] cgcc: fix definition of 'linux' macro ===

Date: Thu, 28 Nov 2019 15:17:59 +0000
Message-ID: <18e4644b-7616-5d74-e298-4506372680b3 () ramsayjones ! plus ! com>
--------------------

During a call to add_specs('linux'), cgcc adds several macro definitions
to the sparse command line. In particular, it provides the incorrect
definition: '-Dlinux=linux'.

This bug was introduced in commit 807f74466b (<no title>, 2004-08-13), while
moving some calls to add_pre_buffer() around in lib.c. This was then moved
out of sparse, into cgcc, by commit cf2bde63a6 (<no title>, 2004-10-05),
where the definition was copied verbatum.

Fix this macro definition to read '-Dlinux=1' instead.

OK, so I wasn't quite as confused as I thought! ;-)

Thanks for the explanation.

=== Thread: [PATCH] dissect: fix processing of ASM statements ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH] dissect: fix processing of ASM statements
Date: Sat, 26 Jan 2019 15:55:43 +0000
Message-ID: <20190126155543.53573-1-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
Before commit 756731e9 ("use a specific struct for asm operands"),
ASM operands ('name', 'constraint, 'expression') were stored as a
sequence of 3 expressions. After, they had their own expression
type: EXPR_ASM_OPERAND.

However, dissect.c:do_asm_xputs() was not adapated for this change.

Fix this in do_asm_xputs() by processing the 'expression' of
every entries (instead of only processing every third entries).

=== Thread: [PATCH] evaluate: externally_visible functions don't need a declaration ===

From: Jann Horn <jannh () google ! com>

Subject: [PATCH] evaluate: externally_visible functions don't need a declaration
Date: Wed, 27 Mar 2019 20:10:38 +0000
Message-ID: <20190327201038.10915-1-jannh () google ! com>
--------------------
sparse warns for non-static functions that don't have a separate
declaration. The kernel contains several such functions that are marked
as __attribute__((externally_visible)) to mark that they are called from
assembly code. Assembly code doesn't need a header with a declaration to
call a function. Therefore, suppress the warning for functions with
__attribute__((externally_visible)).

This patch makes the following warnings disappear:

The variable 'conservative' is used to allow testing some
characteristics of an expression while inhibiting any possible
side-efects like issuing a warning or marking the expression
as erroneous. But this role is not immedialtely apparent.

So, add a comment to the variable declaration.

A conditional only makes sense on a scalar type. If not,
an error is issued.

However, the error message doesn't explain this.

Fix this by adding the explanation to the error message.

=== Thread: [PATCH] fix allowing casts of AS pointers to uintptr_t ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH] fix allowing casts of AS pointers to uintptr_t
Date: Sun, 31 Mar 2019 23:48:10 +0000
Message-ID: <20190331234810.46675-1-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
The patch b3daa62b5 ("also accept casts of AS pointers to uintptr_t")
is bogus and allows uintptr_t as the *source type* instead of the
*target type*. This was helped by a previous bug, in patch
d96da358c ("stricter warning for explicit cast to ulong"), where
a test for Wcast_from_as was wrongly added for the source type.

Fix this by:
* adding the test for uintptr_t to the target type;
* removing the test for Wcast_from_as from the source type,
  replacing it by a test of Wcast_to_as;
* clarify and extend the tge testcases.
So, now, casts from uintptr_t to AS pointers are also allowed.

Fixes: b3daa62b53109dba78c7937b3a6a0cd7d67865d5

=== Thread: [PATCH] improve diagnostic message about wrong redeclaration ===

From: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
To: linux-sparse
Subject: [PATCH] improve diagnostic message about wrong redeclaration
Date: Sun, 15 Dec 2019 16:28:56 +0000
Message-ID: <20191215162856.98943-1-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
The current message is very long (in most cases the position
of the previous declaration is past the 80th column) and,
while saying that the types differ, doesn't show these types.

Change this by splitting the message in 2 parts:
- first, on the current position, the main message
  and the type of the current declaration.
- then the type of the previous declaration on its
  own position.

Absolutely. It wasn't intentional to drop the typediff.

This is the expected behaviour. The constant 0 is magic regarding
bitwise types but ({ ...; 0; }) is not, it is just an ordinary expression
of type 'int'.

So, IMHO, Souptick's patch is the right thing to do.

What "Right Thing" are you thinking about?
One of the simplest situation with these conditional locks is:

	if (test)
		lock();

	do_stuff();

	if (test)
		unlock();

No program can check that the second test gives the same result than
the first one, it's undecidable. I mean, it's undecidable even on
if single threaded and without interrupts. The best you can do is
to simulate the whole thing (and be sure your simulation will halt).

As far as I understand, it was the intention behind Sparse's design
regarding locking ("context in sparse's parlance) to discourage
such code and instead encourage to write things like:

	if (test) {
		do_stuff_unlocked();
	} else {
		lock();
		do_stuff_unlocked();
		unlock();
	}

where it is easy to check localy that the lock/unlock are balanced.

So, of course Sparse could be improved to prove that some of the
conditional locks are equivalent to unconditional ones like here
just above (it already does but only for very simple cases where
everything is inlined) but I don't thing there is a RT.

Sparse will warn on casts removing the address space of a pointer
if the destination type is not unsigned long. But the special role
of 'unsigned long' is not explained in the man page.

So, add a small explanation in the description of -Waddress-space.

I wonder whether another approach to this might be to have a different
warning string when the target type is a number and isn't `unsigned
long`? It seems to me that a self-explaining error message is
preferable to a clarification in the manpage.

Yes, I agree. Have you maybe already something specific in mind?

Note that I only tried here to explain the reason for the *absence*
of the warning when the cast is to 'unsigned long'.
There is also already a(n undocumented) flag -Wpointer-to-int-cast
(but which purpose is slightly different) giving a warning
when a pointer is cast to an integer of a different size.

It would also be good, I think, to have first in the manpage
a description of the different extensions that Sparse have
to C's type system. This should simplify, the description
of the options.

You might as well call it "uintptr_t".

And yes, that is the same as "unsigned long" in all sane
implementations, of course, and yes, the Linux kernel tends to prefer
just using "unsigned long" rather than made-up abstract types
internally.

But when explaining it outside of the Linux kernel context, I think
"uintptr_t" might be a bit more appropriate (perhaps with an "aka
unsigned long", since sparse itself internally also has the same "long
and pointer are basically the same - it's the register size" model).

The logic is that an "uintptr_t" cast isn't really a pointer cast,
it's a "get pointer value representation in an integer type" cast.
Which is address-space independent, which can be used as an
explanation of the logic.

Not really... something like this?

warning: cast from pointer with address space '<asn:1>' to
inappropriate numeric type

Or maybe this?

warning: cast from pointer with address space '<asn:1>' to
inappropriate numeric type [expected 'unsigned long' / 'ptrsize_t']

I'm not really convinced. I'll need to think a bit about it.

How does this interact with the cgcc --target=<spec> and the
(otherwise) guessing of the 'native' specs?

I would rather these were explicitly set to 0.

I didn't yet looked at how it interacts with cgcc --target=<spec>.
I had losely planned to do this after having removed all the defines
in cgcc that are now unneeded (integer_type() and define_size_t()
are now done by sparse itself, float_types() should also).

I think that the OS-specific parts can be kept in cgcc and in
the 'arch' parts it would be easy enough to call sparse with the
right '--arch=<...>' (either guessed via uname or specified via
--target=<spec>, it wouldn't matter).

Do you see some complications?

Hmm ... To me, the difference pop out better like so.
The absence of a value is supposed to mean "there is not
a known size for this, it needs to be calculated/guessed".
I find that an explicit 0 conveys this les well.

No, not really.
The -m32/-m64 flags are still taken in account, before the
--arch and after it too. If no -m32/-m64 is given at all
then the used size is the one of the native arch (because
arch_m64 is initialized so). I think it's quite natural to
use but it lacks some error checking (e.g.: --arch=arm -m64
will purposely *not* select arm64, aka aarach64, but no
warnings will be issued).

heh, yes, I just meant that (if -m32/-m64 has _not_ been given)
then you have a 50/50 chance that you are cross-compiling to a
system that has the same 'bit-ness' as your current platform.

(well, actually, I suppose both are likely to be 64-bit these
days - so, maybe not 50/50! ;-) ).

Yes, I somehow agree. It would probably be better to make 'mips',
'ppc' & 'sparc' default to 32-bit since it's what uname seems to
do (for RISC-V uname returns 'riscv32' or 'riscv64'). For the
kernel, the plain name is always used but -m32/-m64 is awalys given,
so it's never a problem.

Thank you for your input.

It depends. I think that for the kernel it is not needed
because all CFLAGS are also given as CHECKFLAGS (and,
of course, I planning to send in the following days a patch
for the kernel to add 'CHECKFLAGS += --arch=$(ARCH)').
I think that for the kernel it would be enough.

For user-space, part of this is more or less done in the
cgcc script (and you can specifiy the compiler via the
unusual environment variable 'REAL_CC', the idea being
to be able to define cgcc tself as 'CC').

In both cases, arch-specific details surely need to be added,
like the recent -mcmodel for RISC-V. I'm thinking mainly
about '-march' & '-mabi'.
These can be added as needed but are often quite arch-specific
which is currently a problem for Sparse. My longer term plan
is to move everything arch-specific to separated files.

To answer your question, I would say that if you can easily
do it via the makefile or the makefile's configuration,
then do it so.

In evaluate_assignment(), a local variable (named 'where') contains
the input expression (named 'expr', like in most other function).

This is doubly confusing because:
*) both variables hold the same pointer.
*) the name 'where' is normally used for a string with extra
   information for error messages.

So, remove this intermediate and use the original 'expr' instead.

But this is not needed since check_assignment_types() must
anyway do the call to degenerate().

These headers are often complex and full of implementation
specificities. They have no place in the testsuite.

So, remove these includes and replace them by the prototype
of the function being used.

The known-to-fail report of the summary 'line' is
displayed on a second line.

This is somehow annoying, so reformat slightly the summary
to hold in a single line and hopely be clearer too.

--------------------
This patch fixes below spare errors.

Sparse error:
make C=2 CF=-D__CHECK_ENDIAN__ M=net/core
./include/trace/events/neigh.h:73:1: error: directive in argument list
./include/trace/events/neigh.h:78:1: error: directive in argument list
./include/trace/events/neigh.h:150:1: error: directive in argument list
./include/trace/events/neigh.h:155:1: error: directive in argument list

Changes below two lines to signle line to avoid sparse error
 #if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)
               if (n->tbl->family == AF_INET6) {
to if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6) && n->tbl->family == AF_INET6)

and removes reassigning pin6 pointer when IPV6 is enabled

Not sure why the added pin6 assignment was there to begin with:

<code-snippet>
                pin6 = (struct in6_addr *)__entry->primary_key6;
                p32 = (__be32 *)__entry->primary_key4;

                if (n->tbl->family == AF_INET)
                        *p32 = *(__be32 *)n->primary_key;
                else
                        *p32 = 0;

#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)
                if (n->tbl->family == AF_INET6) {
                        pin6 = (struct in6_addr *)__entry->primary_key6;
                        *pin6 = *(struct in6_addr *)n->primary_key;
                } else
#endif
                {
                        ipv6_addr_set_v4mapped(*p32, pin6);
                }
</code-snippet>

It was already assigned. Looks fine to me, at least from a tracing
point of view.

The problem is that #ifdefs at line 73 & 150 are inside TRACE_EVENT()'s
invocation and this is undefined behaviour. From the standard:
	... If there are sequences of preprocessing tokens within the
	list of arguments that would otherwise act as preprocessing
	directives, the behavior is undefined. 

	[C90 6.8.3, C99 & C11 6.10.3p11]

GCC can handle it (and sparse too) but yes sparse complains about it.

Why removing the line wheer pin6 is assigned?
IMO, the patch should be:
-#if IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6)
-		if (n->tbl->family == AF_INET6) {
+		if (IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_IPV6) && n->tbl->family == AF_INET6)
 			pin6 = (struct in6_addr *)__entry->primary_key6;
  			*pin6 = *(struct in6_addr *)n->primary_key;

 Below is the original code

OK, I see. IMO, it would be better to have 2 patches for this:
one for the redundant assignment to pin6 and anotther one for
the IS_ENABLED() change but feel free, if needed, to add my

I agree with it being separate patches. I'm big on the "one patch
accomplishes one task" ideology.

yes, I will take care of the pin6 assignment separately. This patch
can only address the sparse error.

When reading my own patch after it returned to me in my sparse folder I
noticed a fault here. We want the "is" dropped in the above line. Should
I resend for that?

No no, a resend is not needed at all, I've directly changed it.

I can understand the motivation for this but with this the default
*visual* output will be even longer and more redundant:
1) The current idea was if a test doesn't output sommething
   it's that everything was OK. With the patch there will be a
   'PASS' line for each of these tests (more than 90% of them).
2) every FAIL tests have already of line displayed with
   "error: test ... failed" just before the details of the
   failure are displayed (which means that such a line can be
   displayed several time for the same test: bad) and the line
   with FAIL is displayed at the end of the test.
3) in the same message 'XFAIL' & 'is known to fail',
   'XPASS' & 'is known to fail but succeed' and 'FAIL' & 'failed'
   really mean the same (and all of them are grepable); it's just that
   one seems to for humans and the others for some script.

Point 3) doesn't bother me much.
Point 2) is easily fixable (both removing the current repetition in
case of multiple failure in the same test file and the repetion with
FAIL).
Point 1) really bothers me.

I propose to:
*) simply drop the 'PASS' part of the patch
*) add a new flag for test-suite (for example --machine-testing) to:
   -) not display the 'PASS' lines when the flag is not set
   -) display the FAIL, XFAIL, ... tags only when the flag is set
  (I suppose that these FAIL, XFAIL, XPASS ... tags will be used or
  are already used in some concrete automatic system so it wouldn't be
  a problem to launch the testsuite with a flag).
This will keep the current default output (human-)user friendly.

Any thoughts?

OK, I see.
But with your patch, doesn't it also output the PASS line?
	  TEST    extern inline function (extern-inline.c)
	        Using command       : sparse $file $file
	        Expecting exit value: 0
	info: PASS: test 'extern-inline.c' passed

Sure, it makes totally sense.

Yes, I agree. The handling of known-to-fail is quite bad in verbose mode.

The actual use of the 'TEST' lines is partially historical and
partially because I tend to like to have a line with the name
of the file before any details of the error.

Now that I understand your usecase and you make me remember
the problem with the output of known-to-fail test, I'll cook
something that should satisfy everybody (but I don't think that
I'll be be able to do that tomorrow, this WE is FOSDEM, ...).

Thanks for everything.

Subject: [PATCH] validation: Add patterns FAIL, PASS, XPASS and XFAIL to test
Date: Sun, 03 Feb 2019 01:00:35 +0000
Message-ID: <20190203010035.43409-1-luc.vanoostenryck () gmail ! com>
--------------------
From: Uwe Kleine-KÃ¶nig <uwe@kleine-koenig.org>

This simplifies finding the offending test when the build ended with

	KO: out of 584 tests, 527 passed, 57 failed
		56 of them are known to fail

Signed-off-by: Uwe Kleine-KÃ¶nig <uwe@kleine-koenig.org>
Signed-off-by: Luc Van Oostenryck <luc.vanoostenryck@gmail.com>
---

Changes from the original version:
*) remove the "error: test '...' failed" for patterns since it's
   now redundant with the summary XFAIL line.
*) only outputs the PASS line in verbose mode.

This won't work correctly with:
	cgcc -target=i386 -target=cygwin ...
wich I'm using for some testing :)

In this case, hand testing is perfectly fine.

Hi all,

A while ago I talked with various people about whether some static
analsys of copy_to_user() could be productive in finding infoleaks.
Unfortunately, due to the various issues outlined in the patch notes, it
doesn't seem like it is. Perhaps these checks are useful to put in just
to future proof ourselves against these sorts of issues, though.

Anyway, here's the code. Thoughts welcome!

Hi,

Sorry, I've had few available time the last weeks.
I had look at them shortly after you send them but
I haven't yet made my mind about them.

I'm quite reluctant to add complexity (the AST walking)
if it doesn't bring much benefit if any.

In, short the problems are:
1) duplication of the AST walking
2) unreliable type because of using void *
3) unreliable size because array to pointer degeneracy

There is some solutions, though:
1) what *could* be done is to add a method 'check'
   to struct symbol_op and call it, *for example*,
   just after op->expand() in expand_symbol_call()
   (and add a mechanism to set this method for the symbol
   corresponding to copy_to_user()).

   Otherwise, splitting the AST walking from sparse.c
   and making it something generic would be preferable.

   Another approach could be keep the check via OP_CALL
   but doing it just after linearization, before the
   optimization destroy the types (and add, if needed,
   some flag to force linearize_cast() keep absolutely
   all type info).

2) this one seems pretty hopeless

3) the current calls degenerate()/create_pointer()
   do indeed destroy the original type and (at first sight)
   no 'addressof' should exist anymore after evaluation.
   This is inconsistent with the existence of expand_addressof().
   By changing degenerate()/create_pointer() the original
   type should stay available.

Sorry again for the late reply,

Yeah, this sounds like a good option to me.

I was hoping you might have some brilliant insight here. It seems like
these checks could catch real bugs at some point, so I'll give the
changes you've suggested a go over the next couple of weeks and see
about a v2.

Ah ha, thanks. I guess it's not necessary to change create_pointer()
for this, but degenerate() definitely looks important.

Thanks!

=== Thread: [SPARSE] noderef & ASM statements ===

--------------------
I'm investigating some sparse's "warning: unknown expression (4 0)"
on the current kernel. They are a few distinct cases but all of them
are caused by some __builtin_types_compatible_p() not being expanded.

In some of these cases the statement is not expanded because of an
earlier error, for example in compatible_assignment_types(), but
this statement is then linearized anyway. This needs to be be fixed
but is not really a problem.

Another case, much more annoying, is because input & output operands
of ASM statements are not expanded. This is very easy to fix (see
patch here below) but once fixed and used on the kernel, sparse then
issues many thousands of "warning: dereference of noderef expression"
(in fact, more than one million on defconfig + allyesconfig).
These warnings are perfectly correct: a lot of ASM operands are
indeed noderef variables or expressions (most warnings seem to come
from put_user(), get_user() or one of the percpu operations).

I'm quite reluctant to commit a patch that will add so much warnings.
On the other hand, properly silenting these warnings in the kernel
is a non-obvious job, especially given the fact that __force can't
simply be used to 'ignore' __noderef (because the dereferencing
kinda happens before the cast), you need to act via a pointer with
something like:
	*(typeof(X) __kernel __force *) &(X);


The only simple temporary 'solution' is see for the moment would be
to disable 'noderef' warnings while expanding ASM.

No, I think the real fix is to consider memory arguments to asm's to
have an implicit "address_of" operation applied to them.

Basically, the *compiler* never derefences the expression, it's just
given as an address to the asm.

But note that this would require looking at the type of argument to
the asm. If it's a register that the compiler is supposed to fill in,
then the compiler obviously *does* dereference the expression.

But if the asm constraint is "m", then the compiler basically passes
in just he address, and the asm is what *may* do the dereference.

Note the *may*. It's entirely possible that we're passing a memory op
to the inline asm in order for the asm to generate not a dereference,
but something entirely different (like a cache flush, or in the case
of the kernel, maybe a special user access).

Is this somewhat annoying? Yes. But a memory op to an asm really is
more like an address than an access.

Yes, I agree. It's especially visible when looking at uaccess.h's
macro __m() (it dereferences put_user/get_user()'s address argument
just before for 'm' asm operands).

But yes, it's certainly annoying because:
*) the constraints are possibly arch specific
*) the linearization needs to be special cased for asm memory op
   too (but I suppose it must currently be considered as wrong
   for asm memory ops)
*) I've always considered __noderef as really meaning "must not be
   dereferenced except by some special purpose operation which
   effectively do the real deref". In the present case (percpu &
   uaccess (on x86)), it's clear that the special operation is
   the asm memory op but isn't this essentially incidental?


Thinking a bit more about it and looking at some dumps I made:
   It seems that most of these these 'noderef in asm operand'
   warnings (99.5%) come from percpu operations (which have an API
   using an lvalue and not a pointer, unlike the uaccess API).

   I begin to suspect that the warnings occuring with an uaccess
   operation come from some other kind of error (possibly a missing
   call to degenerate()).


Anyway, I'm looking at it.

Hi,

I just spent some time trying to convert some so far PPC-only drivers to
be more generic. One of the things I had to do was convert stuff like

  u32 *val = of_get_property(np, "bla", NULL);
  do_stuff_with(*val);

with

  of_property_read_u32(np, "bla", &val);
  do_stuff_with(val);

(error checking omitted for simplicity). The problem is that
of_get_property() just returns void*. When the property is just a
string, there's no problem interpreting that as a char*. But when the
property is a number of array of numbers, I'd like some way to flag
casting it to u32* as an error - if you cast it to a (pointer to integer
type wider than char), it must be to a __be32*. Is there some way
sparse/smatch could help find such cases?

If I understand you correctly, you would need a kind of 'soft'
bitwise pointer?
I guess it shouldn't be too hard to add a new flag which would
allow cast of bitwise pointers to pointers to char/void (see
at end of evaluate.c:evaluate_cast()).

Note: casts from bitwise pointer to void* are already allowed.

Yes, that's a very good way of putting it.

Hm, yeah, but it should also allow casting to __be32* , but not u32* or
__le32* (though somebody must have gone out of their way to introduce a
bug in the latter case). Don't spend too much time on it, I was just
wondering if there was an easy (maybe already existing) way.

It does, yes.  I'm not sure how big of an issue that is...  I always
just throw a check together and test it before I decide if it's worth
investing more time into it.

Attached.

This has a bunch of flaws like "void *value = p->value;" doesn't
generate a warning.  A function that returns a u32 pointer doing
"return p->value;" doesn't generate a value.

Anyway, it's a starting point to experiment with.

Thank you for the quick updates.
I think everything is covered but my 2 last emails:
* an update about string-- in evaluate_format_printf().
  a test case is the following:
	void prt(const char *, ...) __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2)));
	static void foo(int x, int y, const void *p)
	{
		prt("%02x%02x %8p\n", x, y, p);
	}

* one about get_printf_fmt() and the dereference of expr->string and
  expression's type vs. expr->symbol. A testcase for it is:
	void prt(const char *, ...) __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2)));
	static inline void fun(int x) { prt("%08x\n", x); }
	static void foo(int x)
	{
		fun;
		fun(x);
	}

If you could also add to your tests one like:
	void prt(const char *, ...) __attribute__((format(printf, 1, 2)));
	static void foo(int i, unsigned int u)
	{
		prt("%d\n", i);
		prt("%x\n", u);
	}
This is surprisingly not covered by your more complex ones.

Yes. Sorry if I wasn't clear enough but I said that it needs something
*like* check_assignment_types() instead of directly comparing the pointers.
But, yes, check_assignment_types() itself ignore the size and signedness.

If help is needed, I can look at this in a few days.

There's few enough that it's preferable to just explicitly mark the
source as noreturn too, rather than keep a separate list.

Oh, thanks for this. I was looking for this flag for the past few days...

I guess I'll continue for now with this flag and check without it from

The only architecture, from the above list, that is not supported
by cgcc seems to be ppc32le.

It would be easier to see the results if you _didn't_ add V=1. ;-)

The additional five failures are all in the llvm backend (sparsec),
which you do not need to use sparse as a 'checker'.

Yep, sparse/sparsec do not define various macros that gcc/clang define
by default on a given architecture. This is a known problem (that I have
been meaning to fix ...). The 'workaround' for the time being is to use
the cgcc front-end to sparse. (for example 'make CC=cgcc', or perhaps
'cgcc -no-compile').

This problem became visible during the make check phase when creating packa=
ged
on the listed archs for horst[1]. You can see a build logs at

	https://buildd.debian.org/status/fetch.php?pkg=3Dhorst&arch=3Ds390x&ver=3D=

=3D5.0-1&stamp=3D1503906226&raw=3D0

The error message looks identical (I checked the ppc64el log) to the
problem with backend/sum.c:

	sparse -g -O2 -fdebug-prefix-map=3D/<<PKGBUILDDIR>>=3D. -fstack-protector-=

That is very much like on x86_64 missing define "#weak_define __x86_64__ 1"

Does cgcc work for you? In the future we do want to move the archetecture
related define from cgcc into sparse by itself. For now you can set
"sparse" as "cgcc -no-compile"

Hmm, I don't think that would be a good idea ...

I now understand (I think!) that you are building a sparse
package (presumably a .deb) and you are concerned that sparse
does not pass it's own testsuite on those platforms.

As I said before, the additional failures you are seeing are
in the 'llvm backend' code (which, as far as I know, only passes
on x86_64 Linux), and in my opinion the llvm-backend programs should
not be installed. (The Makefile will build them automatically if
you have llvm installed, likewise for c2xml/libxml and test-inspect/gtk).

[I would like to see build variable(s) to allow the user to suppress
the build (or installation) of the other 'non-primary' sparse programs.]

Anyway, if you were to un-install llvm, sparse-llvm etc., would not
be built, and the tests would not be run ... ;-)

Christopher, as the project maintainer, has the joy of making these
kinds of decisions! :-D

ATB,
Ramsay Jones

I don't like that. It means the user can't invoke sparse directly.

First of all. It is not very trivial to teach sparse about the architecture
stuff. To my mind, we need to move all the cgcc logic into sparse.

For this case, I think it is easier to teach the sparse validation
code to use cgcc on those back end testing. Most validation don't
need to include system header file at all so it does not have
this problem.

How about this patch?
I know my patch is white space damaged in email.
Git branch is at:
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/sparse/chrisl/sparse.git/log/?h=3Dllvm=
-cgcc

Please let me know if that fix your problem. It pass check
on my local machine running x86_64. I don't have ppc64 to
test with.

I think Uwe already confirm using cgcc to invoke sparse will
fix the problem.

In this test, we just need to use cgcc to invoke sparse-llvm.
I have a patch to fix the usage in test-suite in the other email.

Related to that: while it would mean we couldn't necessarily just rely
entirely on GCC's definitions for a target platform, I think in an ideal
world we could have a sparse binary that understood *all* target
platforms at once, such that you could ask Sparse on x86_64 to "compile"
as though targeting any arbitrary architecture. That would also have the
major advantage of making it easy to run the Sparse testsuite for
*every* target architecture without needing compilers for every such
architecture.

You'd need the target arch's system headers though. But still it would
be great. In a first attempt something like:

	#ifdef __powerpc__
		add_pre_buffer("#weak_define __powerpc__ " __powerpc__ "\n");
	#ifdef _CALL_ELF
		add_pre_buffer("#weak_define _CALL_ELF " _CALL_ELF "\n");
	#endif
	#endif

would be helpful already.

Uwe

Well right now I have simply disabled the checks for those broken
architectures, so sparse isn't as affected anymore.

Frankly, I don't quite know what to do with this - but I'd be happy to
happly that patch to sparse if it fixes the issue better.

You patch definitely works.
I think it is the better way to fix it.
Sparse "selfcheck" target was doing the same thing.
It is using "cgcc -no-compile" already.

I suggest in your patch you can do some thing
similar to "selfcheck" target:

CHECKER =3D cgcc -no-compile

         $(CHECKER) $(CFLAGS) *.[ch]

Later when we update sparse to handle architecture
properly. We can just invoke make with "CHECKER=3Dxxxx"
to test.

Agree.

Yes, that is what I want to have. It is list as one of the project in
project idea document as well. I have  a related question. How do we
test the different architecture handling without actually run sparse
on different platform? I am thinking maybe using gcc cross platform
compiler and compare some macro against the sparse one.

Another way to fix the test suite for now would be let testsuite
specify using cgcc instead of sparse directly, for the test source
that needs it. That will buy us some time. Fixing sparse properly
in the long term obvious would be better.

Only for building userspace code, not for building standalone/kernel
code, or the Sparse testsuite.

I think that is a good point. We can start cleaning up the system header

I think we can just sparse default to as late as the latest release

I am tempting to make the endianness the same as the host gcc by default.
Then it can be overwrite by architecture flags.

I purpose just sync to the latest gcc version (or a late enough version
we can agree on. e.g. the one that supported by kernel compile.) Sparse
current try to sync to the latest gcc attributes already.

Is there a way to do auto-extract? That would be a good starting point.

Sparse is not universal, it just support a very small sub set of the C
source file that haven't expose to those platform detail macros. Adding
those architecture macro support will not make it any less universal.
Might slow things down, that is some thing we need to watch out for.

and while it's ok to test the core stuff and not wanting the system

No, it's not solved. But given that it is somehow known that sparse
(without cgcc) fails to work well on userspace stuff, I think the
following would be fine for the Debian side:

 a) let horst use cgcc instead of sparse
 b) downgrade bug to important or even normal pointing out that cgcc
    should be used for userspace programs

For sparse it would be cool to:

 c) drop the #weak_define of __amd64__ to make this "problem" more
    apparent. (Assuming this doesn't break e.g. a kernel build.)
 d) fix the test suite, at least mark the tests that are expected to
    fail on !x86 as such to make $(make check) succeed. (Otherwise I'd
    have to disable or ignore the testsuite which isn't that great.)

ok, Antoine, can you talk to the horst people and ask them to switch to
cgcc then?

There is https://dsa.debian.org/doc/guest-account/ which would give you
the possibility to access some Debian machines. Other than that I intend
to upload 0.5.1 to Debian soon and then can provide you links to build
failures in the build server farm :-) And if you have a patch, I can
volunteer to make the test monkey for you.

Testing that patch is on my todo list.

It clearly looks as the code generated by LLVM  (the machine code/assembly
not LLVM's bytecode) is not understood by the assembler (or at least some
instructions). Probably a mismatch with the architecture version or somethi=
ng
like that.

I fully test on x86, x86-64, arm & ARM64 (with LLVM 3.9 or 4.0).
I also test on ppc64 but not the LLVM part because the machines I have
access to have not LLVM installed and I never bothered to install it myself=
.

Would it be possible to have access to a machine with the architectures
you care about?

Meanwhile, is it possible to have the build logs but with 'make V=3D1 ...' =
?
It would also be useful to have:
- the output of 'uname -a'
- the details about the version of LLVM you're using

On the other hand, you/us should disable the sparse-llvm part since:
- it's something that is bundled and build by default but absolutely not
  needed (or even useful) to use sparse.
- it hasn't been written for anything else than x86/x86-64 (no 'layout'
  for anything else than those architectures.

OK.
I'll first try to install LLVM on what I have already access, it
should be faster.

Yes, enough to investigate the problem. Thanks.

Perfect.
With this, you should be unblocked.

@Chris,
can you apply the patch, please?

I've taken a look at it what happens.
The problem is easy to identify and very annoying to solve:
in sparsec (a wrapper for sparse-llvm + llc + as [+ ld]) there
is a discrepancy between the defaults for llc and as.
'llc' seems to default to the sub-architecture of the build machine
(possibly including the most modern features) while 'as' defaults
to the minimal features for the build machine architecture.

The problem can be solved (on the machine I have access to) by either:
- using the option "-mgeneric" for llc
- using the option "-mpower8" for as

Something smarter would be better.

BTW, if I want to get a PPC64 machine for Linux testing purpose, is the
used apple G5 a good place to start?

Tell me if you want to do that. And plan for a delay because there is
some "paper work" to be done before; mainly by other people, so it might
(or might not) take a moment.

Honestly I don't know. https://wiki.debian.org/ppc64el tells

	Debian/ppc64el requires, at minimum, a POWER8 processor machine.
	Although Debian was initially bootstrapped on a POWER7 set of
	servers. this class of server is not supported anymore, and you
	are not able to run Debian/ppc64el on a POWER7 processor without
	hitting an illegal instruction fault.

Hm https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POWER8 tells:

	Systems based on POWER8 became available from IBM in June
	2014. Systems and POWER8 processor designs made by other
	OpenPOWER members was available in early 2015.

So I think this rules out a G5.

https://wiki.debian.org/ppc64el/Installation mentions you can run this
under qemu however.

Best regards
Uwe

Just a heads up: I uploaded 0.5.2 to Debian and there are problems left
on hurd-i386 (where PATH_MAX isn't defined[1]) and x32 where I get:

	env CHECK=3D./sparse ./cgcc -no-compile memops.c
	/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnux32/gnu/stubs.h:10:12: error: unable to
open 'gnu/stubs-64.h'

The stubs.h file looks as follows:

#if !defined __x86_64__
# include <gnu/stubs-32.h>
#endif
#if defined __x86_64__ && defined __LP64__
# include <gnu/stubs-64.h>
#endif
#if defined __x86_64__ && defined __ILP32__
# include <gnu/stubs-x32.h>
#endif

Given that libc6-dev only provides stubs-x32.h from these three, I guess
we must not define __LP64__ in this case. I don't have a x32 machine
handy, but the complete build log of the auto builder can be found at

For what it's worth, this doesn't work with the latest horst. I've
reported the bug upstream now and disabled the checks for all
architectures now that it also fails on amd64.

Hi,

The issue showed there, more precisely the one:
  /usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/bits/mathcalls-helper-functions.h:21:1: error: Expected ) in function declarator
is caused by sparse's lack of support for _Float128 and occurs with
recent version of glibc.

This has been fixed and upstreamed (see
https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/devel/sparse/sparse.git/commit/?id=4e9c8ee467dd87d41d5aaa3c5a487e3f05ffb79c
for more details).
 
Best regards,
-- Luc
